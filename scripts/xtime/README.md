## üöÄ Implementation

### Google Tag Manager
1. Create a new **Custom HTML Tag**
2. Copy the entire script from `message-tracking.js`
3. Set trigger to **All Pages** (or pages with XTime widgets)
4. Save and publish

### Manual Implementation
Add the script before your closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<!-- XTime Message Tracking -->
<script>
// Paste the message-tracking.js content here
</script>
üîß Configuration
Adding Additional Origins
If you use different XTime domains, add them to the allowed origins:
javascriptvar ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
  "https://consumer8x5.xtime.com",
  "https://consumer.xtime.com",
  "https://your-custom-xtime-domain.com" // Add your domain
];
Custom Data Layer Name
To use a different dataLayer name:
javascript// Replace this line:
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
window.dataLayer.push(data);

// With your custom name:
window.yourDataLayer = window.yourDataLayer || [];
window.yourDataLayer.push(data);
Disable Deduplication
To receive all messages (including duplicates):
javascript// Comment out or remove these lines:
var tryHash = hash(JSON.stringify(data));
if (tryHash === lastPayloadHash) return;
lastPayloadHash = tryHash;
üß™ Testing

üêõ Troubleshooting
No Events Firing

Verify XTime widget is properly loaded
Check that widget origin matches allowed origins
Ensure GTM tag fires on pages with XTime widgets
