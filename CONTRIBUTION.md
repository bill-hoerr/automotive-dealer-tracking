### Adding New Vendor Scripts

When adding support for a new automotive vendor:

1. **Create vendor directory**:
scripts/
└── new-vendor-name/
├── enhanced-tracking.js
├── README.md
└── examples/

2. **Required files**:
   - Main tracking script (`.js` file)
   - Comprehensive README with implementation guide
   - Usage examples and test cases

3. **Script requirements**:
   - Must work across different website platforms
   - Include error handling and debugging features
   - Follow privacy-compliant data collection practices
   - Push events to standard dataLayer format

### Code Standards

#### JavaScript Style
- Use ES5 syntax for maximum compatibility
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Add descriptive comments and documentation
- Use consistent variable naming (`camelCase`)

#### Example Script Structure:
```javascript
// Vendor Enhanced Tracking Script
// Description of what it does and why

(function() {
  'use strict';
  
  // Configuration and settings
  var settings = {
    // Default configuration
  };
  
  // Core tracking functions
  function trackSpecificEvents() {
    // Implementation
  }
  
  // Error handling
  function handleErrors(error) {
    console.error('[Vendor Tracker] Error:', error);
  }
  
  // Initialization
  function initTracking() {
    try {
      // Initialize tracking methods
      console.log('[Vendor Tracker] Initialized');
    } catch (e) {
      handleErrors(e);
    }
  }
  
  // Auto-initialize
  if (document.readyState === 'loading') {
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', initTracking);
  } else {
    initTracking();
  }
})();
